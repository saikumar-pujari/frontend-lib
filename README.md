# Frontend UI Library 🚀

A modern **Frontend UI Component Library** built using **React (`.jsx`)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This repository focuses on creating **reusable, scalable, and clean UI components** that can be easily integrated into any React project.

Currently, the library is **Tailwind CSS–based**, with **Bootstrap components planned within the next 2 weeks**, and more UI frameworks to be added in the future.

### the bootstrap is a file which re-useable code only!! they are bunch of re-usable codes only!

## 🎨 Tailwind CSS Explained

This library is built using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- No large CSS files
- Faster UI development
- Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Highly customizable
- Easy to maintain at scale

All styling is done **directly inside JSX using utility classes**, avoiding traditional CSS where possible.

## 🧩 Example Component (Tailwind + JSX)

```jsx
const PrimaryButton = ({ label }) => {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-indigo-700 transition">
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

export default PrimaryButton;
```
# Tailwind CSS Basics

This repository contains my hands-on practice and experiments while learning Tailwind CSS.

The goal is to understand utilities, layout systems, and component building by writing real examples instead of only reading theory.

## What you'll find here
- Utility-first styling examples
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Responsive design practice
- Small UI components

## Having doubts?
If something is confusing or unclear, the best place to get accurate and complete information is the official Tailwind CSS documentation.

This repo is purely for learning and exploration. Expect frequent updates and improvements.
